Simple oAuth AIR application that can be used as a base for the client.

Uses the tweetr library: http://wiki.swfjunkie.com/tweetr , swc included.
Tweetr requires As3crypto: http://code.google.com/p/as3crypto/ , swc also included.

To get the oAuth to run correctly, the consumerKey and consumerSecret must be filled out for the application.

Once the oAuth login has completed, all this prototype does is to pull down and display the logged in user timeline.
